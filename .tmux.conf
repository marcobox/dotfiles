#		#[attributes]     Colour or attribute change
#		#H                Hostname of local host

# ment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).
#
# [attributes] allows a comma-separated list of attributes to be specified, these may be ‘fg=colour’ to set the 
# foreground colour, ‘bg=colour’ to set the background colour, the name of one of the attributes (listed under
# the message-attr option) to turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off, for 
# example nobright
